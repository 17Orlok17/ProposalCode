Welcome, daring adventurer!  A great quest lies before you.
Long ago, a polar bear fell in love with a hedgehog.
Fate, in its prodigous cruelty, separated them for many years.
However, their love for each other only grew.  

At last, the hour of reunion approached, and in accordance with 
ancient customs, they chose a ring for the beautiful hedgehog.
The polar bear, however, was careful.  He took precautions so
that the ring would not fall into the wrong hands.  

He created a layered security system.  This program will ask
questions that only the hedgehog could know.  However, as an 
added layer of protection, you will need to recover physical 
clues to unlock the next question.  

Once you have answered all the questions - with your memory
and the physical clues, the location of the ring will be revealed.
